# MSGraph

A module for AWS Lambda that
1. retrieves the newest unread email from an O365 inbox,
2. carves all files from top-level message, attached messages, and archives,
3. drops those files into an S3 bucket for further analysis, then
4. marks the message as read.

## Getting Started

The module is designed to be tested locally by direct invocation, dropping carved files to ```./tmp```.
