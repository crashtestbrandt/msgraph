# MSGraph

A module for AWS Lambda that retrieves the newest unread email from an O365 inbox, carves all files from top-level message, attached messages, and archives, and then drops those files into an S3 bucket for further analysis.

## Getting Started

The module is designed to be tested locally by direct invocation, dropping carved files to ```./tmp```.
